# Silly Noises Tool

## Silly Noises Tool with GUI for just some good ol'fashioned fun!

The Silly Noises Tool is a very silly tool that triggers a sound on the user's PC that this tool is installed on, depending on how many clicks a specific button press made. 

Great fun can be had that includes, but isn't limited to:
- Reminder to smile, as you enable this on your machine with a fun noise to make you feel joy.
- Fun prank to pull on a friend, spouse, family member, neighbor, or enemy - your pick.
